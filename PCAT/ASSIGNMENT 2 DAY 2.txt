
Assignment 2: Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate
the nth Fibonacci number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. Compare this with an iterative 
approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and timeÂ complexity.
recursive approach:
function fibonacci(num):
if(num<=1)
print num
else
return fibonacci(num-1)+fibonacci(n-2)
iterative approach:
function fibonacci iterative(num):
if (num==0)
print 0
else if(num==1)
print 1
fib 1=0
fib2=1
fib 3
for i in the range of o to num
fib3=fib1+fib2
fib1=fib2
fib2=fib3
end for 
print fib3
Explanation:according to the above approaches if wehave smaller values then recursive approach is good.
but we have larger values then iterative approach is better than recursive approach.recursive is very easy
to undertand compared to iterative approach.
